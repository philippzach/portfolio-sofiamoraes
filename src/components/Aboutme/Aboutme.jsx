            <p>I am a graphic designer specialized in web design, user interface, content production and branding identity.</p>
            <p>
            I'm originally from Venezuela, but I have spent the last 7 years traveling the world using my creative and physical skills, my obsession with order and perfection has made me a graphic designer of high caliber, my passion for imagery and moments has given me the opportunity to transmit sensations through the lens.
            </p>
            <p>
            I love to find the balance between beauty and usefulness, create aesthetic solutions that propel towards a more united world and collaborate with awesome and creative people all over the globe.
            </p>
            <p>In my spare time you will find me only in one place: the ocean</p>
