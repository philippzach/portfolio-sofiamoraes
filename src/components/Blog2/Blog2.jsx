            TYPOGRAPHY, even when poorly executed, can never be taken for granted; nor is it ever accidental. Indeed,
            beauti- fully typeset pages are always the result of long experience. Now and then they even attain the rank
            who constantly ponders matters of readability and legibility, it is difficult to determine whether something
            can be read with ease, but the average reader will rebel at once when the type is too small or otherwise
            irritates the eye; both are signs of a certain illegibility already.

            All typography consists of letters. These appear either in the form of a smoothly running sentence or as an
            assembly of lines, which may even have contrasting shapes. Good typog- raphy begins, and this is no minor
            too wide or too compressed, will spoil almost any typeface.
